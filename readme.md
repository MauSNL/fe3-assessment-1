## Workflow

At first I looked at the data available and look at some examples in the basic chart library. Most of them used .tsv, atleast the ones I looked at, so I decided to go with the languages.

###### Explore

Explore the [data][].  Make sense of the rows, columns, and what they contain.
Investigate interesting aspects and possible outcomes.  Figure out what type of
chart you want and sketch your visualisation.

List the features needed to make your chart work and make sure they match our
[rubric][].  For example, pie charts or donut charts often lack features needed
to get good grades in the **application of subject matter** category.  You must
compensate with other useful features to get a good grade in this case.

Pick the most enticing data and copy it to your fork.

###### Process

Describe the purpose and background of your visualisation in your forkâ€™s readme.
Portray your data and list the d3 features.

Start writing code.  Feel free to use example code found on the web but make
sure to include correct citations.  Use inline code comments to describe
anything of interest.  Donâ€™t forget to document your process.

###### Review

Finish up your readme and review your project.  Audit the code and docs.
Evaluate whether the project matches our [rubric][] and make changes where
needed.

Include anything youâ€™re particularly proud of and mention anything that was
exceptionally hard to accomplish in your readme to make sure lecturers donâ€™t
miss it!  ðŸŒŸ
